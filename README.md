This is My Angular Mean App. I created a simple student database where the user can enter details. Name, College, Course and Year. For this project i used mLab as a database server for when the student info is entered it will read into the database. I have a delete and edit function for the student info. I implemented a simple colleges of ireland component as it was a minimum requirement to have at least four components. For css i installed the angular materials and imported pre sets. I used these as i like the clean look of it. A very simple app but im happy with the work i put in. I had this idea from the start and never thought of changing. 

To get the server going its the Local Host of 8081. In cmd: ng server.js
To view the app its Local Host of 4200. Which is shown below. In cmd: ng serve
